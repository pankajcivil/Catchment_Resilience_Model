Catchment_Resilience_Model
==========================

This project presents a catchment hydrological resilence model for modelling hydrological attractors within a semi-distributed catchment. The model is written in object-oriented Matlab and allows the identifictaion of hydrological attractors using limit-cycle continuation and stochastic simulations. A versions of this model was published with Peterson and Western (2014) and using in Peterson et al. (2009) Peterson et al. (2014). Please contact Tim Peterson (timjp@unimelb.edu.au) for copies of the papers.
